        <description>Before [PAWN_nameDef] could even speak, [PAWN_possessive] world was ravaged by worldwide pandemic. The next few years of [PAWN_possessive] life were spent in isolation with only [PAWN_possessive] parents for company. However, [PAWN_possessive] parents kept [PAWN_objective] busy, nurturing a natural talent for the arts and sciences.</description>
