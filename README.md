# Rosen-Backstories
![Preview Image](About/Preview.png "Preview")

Part serious mod, part attempt to learn to mod RimWorld.  My initial goal was to add   more variety to the "Researcher" category of backstories, since "The Anomaly" backstories felt unvaried.  As such things happen, this mod has expanded in scope to add some book and media references, add additional generic childhood backstories, and add some knights, and some classic old scifi.
    
The mod does not require additional mods, but some backstories will take advantage of Vanilla Traits Expanded and Vanilla Armour Expanded if you have them. Most of the backstories have a thematically appropriate forced trait, which makes debugging a bit easier for me.  For example, the "Waste of Talent" backstory forces the Slowpoke and Slothful traits.

GNU Terry Pratchett.

## Philosophy

### Lore
- Backstories should be lore friendly. 
  - Backstories from other media franchises are fine, but should be adapted to be as lore friendly as possible, such at discworld dwarves becoming dirtmoles. 

### Mechanics
- Most adult backstories are balanced around a +6/+4/+2 bonus with a positive trait.
- Backstories are allowed to be stronger, but definitely need some drawback or must be extremely compelling.
