When not on duty, [PAWN_nameDef] occupied [PAWN_objective]self with cultivating numerous potted plants and helping out in the hydroponics bay. 

Enigma - Systems have almost no records of [PAWN_nameDef]'s childhood, nor any explanation of how [PAWN_pronoun] rose to such a high rank at such an early age.  The only thing sparse accounts can agree on is the [PAWN_nameDef] has always been preternaturally beautiful and always able to convince others to do exactly what [PAWN_pronoun] needed.

Shipborn engineer - Despite all the cautions, regulations, and prophylactics intended to prevent shipborn pregnancies, it is not uncommon for a child to be born on a ship during a long transit.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] spent [PAWN_possessive] childhood aboard one such ship, obesssively learning the ins and outs of the engine room and all the maintenance required to keep [PAWN_possessive] home among the stars going.

Expedition survivor - After an ill-fated expedition drew the ire of a particularly malevolent archotech, [PAWN_nameDef] has been on the run ever since, pursued by mechanoids and horrid fleshbeasts.

Revenant survivor - During a routine patrol, [PAWN_nameDef] was attacked by an invisible spectre and left in an unwaking nightmare, dreaming of realities and worlds where [PAWN_pronoun] was stranded on a Rimworld.  All [PAWN_possessive] dreams ended with [PAWN_possessive] death and the deaths of everyone around [PAWN_objective].\n\nWhen [PAWN_pronoun] finally awoke, [PAWN_pronoun] was left with the determination to survive and protect those close to [PAWN_objective].  At any cost.

Glitterworld physician - Even in a world mostly free of disease and human suffering, there were still accidents that required quick human intervention.  While not as lucrative a career as cosmetic alterations and much more stressful, [PAWN_nameDef] found [PAWN_possessive] time as a emergency physician much more worthwhile.  Eventually, [PAWN_nameDef] adapted to the long hours without resorting to wake-up or copious amounts of caffeine.

Dealmaker - Groomed from an early age to [PAWN_nameDef] to take over [PAWN_possessive] mother's organization, [PAWN_nameDef] was an effective leader and dealmaker, effectuating multiple mergers and acquisitions of competitors.  When some of the new internal intelligence they aquired from an aquisition pointed to an extremely large cache of archotech artifacts on a not too distant rimworld, [PAWN_pronoun] organized an expedition to retrieve and study them.  It was the only way for [PAWN_objective] to forge a path different than what her mother had created for her.

Archotech salvager - [PAWN_nameDef] made a living hunting for ruined or dormant archotech relics and ship parts, extracting their vanometric power cells and other such technologies.

Babel curator - [PAWN_nameDef] claimed to be from a transcendent world, tasked by an archotech to collect as many written stories as possible, with the goal of building a library to hold every text that has been and will be written. 

Medieval enthusiast - Teaching at a glitterworld university, [PAWN_nameDef]'s research focused on the history of combat techniques from thousands of years ago.  This may just have been an excuse for [PAWN_objective] to get paid for [PAWN_possessive] hobby of dressing up in armor and pretending to be a knight.\n\nWhile [PAWN_nameDef] spent a considerable amount of time outdoors thanks to [PAWN_possessive] hobby, very little of it was spent in green spaces or wilderness.

Waste of talent - [PAWN_nameDef] was naturally good at everything, but completely unmotivated to make anything of [PAWN_possessive] life.

Food chemist - [PAWN_nameDef] lived a life of luxury on a glitterworld. [PAWN_possessive] primary research involved creating new and exotic artificial flavors.

Glitterworld librarian - [PAWN_nameDef] managed an enormous library on a glitterworld. [PAWN_possessive] ability to sift through billions of entries and materials in a matter of seconds was matched only by their complete incompetence in crafts.  There was nothing physical [PAWN_nameDef] could make that would not collapse in a matter of seconds.

Inventive janitor - Held captive on a space satellite and forced by mad scientists to watch cheesy movies (the worst they could find) [PAWN_nameDef] was only able to keep [PAWN_possessive] sanity with the help of [PAWN_possessive] robot friends. [PAWN_nameDef] crafted the aforementioned robots [PAWN_possessive]self, using spare parts from the satellite \n\nDespite the dire, dangerous, and utterly bizarre conditions [PAWN_pronoun] found [PAWN_possessive]self in, [PAWN_nameDef] maintained a positive attitude throughout it all.

Knight - [PAWN_nameDef] served in the army as a means to live the dream of being a knight. Wealthy, [PAWN_pronoun] could afford the most advanced powered armor to protect [PAWN_possessive] skin.

Wind chaser - [PAWN_nameDef] claimed [PAWN_pronoun] once called upon the wind and the wind answered.  Since that event, [PAWN_pronoun] traveled far and wide, searching for the name of the wind.

Charitable physician - [PAWN_nameDef] would travel to settlements without medical infrastructure to provide care for those who would otherwise be unable to receive it.  Despite the constant danger, [PAWN_pronoun] abided by a millennia old oath to do no harm.\n\n[PAWN_possessive] patients would remember [PAWN_possessive] calm and kind demeanor years after.

Medieval knight - [PAWN_nameDef] was drafted into [PAWN_possessive] lord's army. [PAWN_pronoun] was knighted for saving the life of the crown prince on the battlefield, at great personal risk.

Xenogeneticist - While [PAWN_pronoun] could have easily made a living as a model, [PAWN_nameDef] found [PAWN_objective]self drawn towards more intellectual pursuits. The majority of [PAWN_nameDef]'s efforts were spent on the research and development of new xenogerms and treatments of genetic disorders.\n\n[PAWN_possessive] career was interrupted by the sudden decline of their glitterworld;  [PAWN_nameDef]'s ideoligion made a convenient scapegoat and [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to flee the planet.

Infantry engineer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as an engineer in the army on a relatively peaceful urbworld. Most of [PAWN_possessive] active service was spent in disaster recovery efforts. Fortunately many of the same skills needed to sap walls or build bridges and defenses were easily transferable to rescue operations and building shelters.  This was probably for the best, as [PAWN_pronoun] was barely able to take a punch from a genie.

Mobile infantryman - [PAWN_nameDef]'s planet made some form of military or government service a requirement of gaining the right to vote. [PAWN_pronoun] joined the mobile infantry and took to maneuvering in powered armor like a fish to water.  The majority of [PAWN_possessive] deployment was spent fighting against an incursion of the Sorne geneline on nearby planets.  Despite the horrors of war, [PAWN_nameDef] maintained an unshakable confidence that [PAWN_pronoun] would pull through no matter what.

Mobile infantryman - [PAWN_nameDef] joined the mobile infantry to fight the Sorne geneline's incursion on a nearby world.  [PAWN_possessive] first drop against the bugs ended in disaster, with [PAWN_nameDef] being the only survivor.  However, due to a computer glitch, [PAWN_pronoun] was sent on drops again and again without time for rest. By [PAWN_possessive] 20th drop, the glitch was discovered, but not before [PAWN_pronoun] had transformed into an emotionally damaged, but highly capable, killing machine.

Spy - [PAWN_nameDef] was an extremely accomplished spy, specializing in impersonation and long-term infiltration.

Spy - [PAWN_nameDef] worked for a governmental intelligence agency, specializing in tailing and infiltration.

Glitterworld politician - [PAWN_nameDef] served as a democratically elected leader on a prosperous glitterworld.  While [PAWN_possessive] tenure was originally seen as a time of prosperity, [PAWN_possessive] immediate successor implemented radical policies that led to the rapid decline of [PAWN_possessive] home planet. [PAWN_nameDef]'s ideoligion made a convenient scapegoat and [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to flee the planet.

Duelist - While outlawed on some worlds, dueling remained a popular way to settle disputes on many others, especially among the nobility and upper classes.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] gained renown on one such world for [PAWN_possessive] skill with the blade.  [PAWN_pronoun] spent much of their spare time honing their skills and studying ancient treatises.

Swordmaster - While never sure of the precise locations of the planets "Germany" or "Italy," [PAWN_nameDef] had nevertheless studied and mastered all the dueling treatises written by the swordmasters of those places, and supported [PAWN_objective]self as a professional duelist.

Ordinary colonist - [PAWN_nameDef] records are startlingly unremarkable and contain no data of interest or importance.  It is not suspicious in the slightest.

Blood knight - [PAWN_nameDef] wanted nothing more in life than a small farm to call [PAWN_possessive] own and a partner to settle down with.  Or so [PAWN_nameDef] believed until [PAWN_possessive] small village was attacked by a group of sanguophages.  After beheading three of them with nothing more than a farming implement, something awoke within [PAWN_objective].\n\nSince that day, [PAWN_nameDef] has been seeking out any excuse to get into danger, to feel that thrill of being on the knife's edge between life and death.

Ship stealer - Despite being absolutely sickened by the idea of hurting another human, [PAWN_nameDef] became one of the most notorius and successful pirates of [PAWN_possessive] generation through nothing more than a quick wit, silver tongue, and shameless audacity.  Once, alone, [PAWN_pronoun] even stole a large grav-ship that required a thrity person crew.

Ship's mechanic - [PAWN_nameDef] worked as a ships mechanic, repairing faulty equipment and doing general maintenance on long-haul trade ships between star systems.  The ship's cook was rarely out of cryosleep during the maintenance cycles, so [PAWN_nameDef] had to learn to cook their own food if they wanted to avoid the nutrient paste.

Astronomer - [PAWN_nameDef] worked as an astronomer.  One day, during an analysis of prior routine observations, [PAWN_nameDef] abruptly quit [PAWN_possessive] job and booked the first ticket offworld available.  Hours later, [PAWN_possessive] home planet was reportedly destroyed by a previously undetected mass travelling at a relativistic speed.

Toymaker - [PAWN_nameDef] spent much of [PAWN_possessive] life designing and creating toys for children. Warm, genial, and known for [PAWN_possessive] remarkable charity, [PAWN_pronoun] was only ever angry when a child was put in danger.

Clerk - [PAWN_nameDef] worked a thankless job as a tiny cog in a large bureaucratic machine.

[PAWN_pronoun] learned surprising breadth of material from all that reading.

Clerk - [PAWN_nameDef] worked a thankless job as a tiny cog in a large bureaucratic machine.

Clerk - [PAWN_nameDef] was one of a faceless team of software engineers in a large and extremely powerful urbworld corporation. [PAWN_pronoun] was extremely well paid, but hated [PAWN_possessive] job.\n\nOne day, [PAWN_nameDef] realized that [PAWN_pronoun] could pay a programmer from the lower levels of the urbworld to do [PAWN_possessive] work for [PAWN_objective], leaving [PAWN_objective]self free to do as [PAWN_pronoun] pleased.

Manager - [PAWN_nameDef] worked for a large corporation, where [PAWN_pronoun] was rapidly promoted up the management chain due to a combination of charm, ruthlessness, and a talent for getting things done. [PAWN_pronoun] was particularily driven to get what [PAWN_pronoun] deserved, and wasn't above getting [PAWN_possessive] hands dirty if [PAWN_possessive] underlings were not up to the task at hand.        

Manager - [PAWN_nameDef] was rapidly promoted until, as per the Peter Principle, found themselves in a role [PAWN_pronoun] were completely unqualified for.  [PAWN_pronoun] never seemed to understand why so many of [PAWN_possessive] subordinates quit their jobs.

Silent model - [PAWN_nameDef] was considered to be incredibly attractive, at least until [PAWN_pronoun] opened [PAWN_possessive] mouth. [PAWN_pronoun] made the most of it and made a living as a model and acting roles that didn't require [PAWN_pronoun] to speak.

Fast food worker - Many urbworlds are harsh and extremely competitive.  The underlying reasons differ from world to world, but there is immense societal pressure to work long hours for effectively very little.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] adjusted to this environment by focusing on what [PAWN_pronoun] could control and not participating in the rat race.  [PAWN_pronoun] lived very simply, tended to [PAWN_possessive] potted plants, and enjoyed [PAWN_possessive] job as a fast food cook.

Urbworld farmer - While the term urbworld often conjures the image of a planet-spanning city, a number of urbworlds do have quite a fair amount of open space, but the population is almost entirely commpressed into megacities for more efficient infrastructure. Food is often grown in massive hydroponics skyscrapers, overseen by agricultural specialists such as [PAWN_nameDef].

Urbworld farmer - While the term urbworld often conjures the image of a planet-spanning city, a number of urbworlds do have quite a fair amount of open space, but the population is almost entirely commpressed into megacities for more efficient infrastructure.

Former dictator - [PAWN_nameDef] once ruled an entire planet with an iron appendage, but when [PAWN_pronoun] saw that the latest round of protests were not so easily quelled and [PAWN_possessive] supposedly loyal military was planning a coup, [PAWN_pronoun] secretly gathered [PAWN_possessive] ill-gotten riches and fled the planet.

Medical student - [PAWN_nameDef] studied at a prestigious medical academy.

Fencing club member - While others were out partying, going to the gym, and forming romances, [PAWN_nameDef] was studying the blade. [PAWN_pronoun] was also doing those other things, since being an active member of [PAWN_possessive] school's martial arts club was an extremely social affair.

Hunter - Upon moving to a heavily forested area in [PAWN_possessive] teens, [PAWN_nameDef] quickly became obsessed with hunting.  The bigger the game, the better.

Big game hunter - An avid hunter, [PAWN_nameDef] eventually found hunting wildlife to be cruel and lacking challenge.  Thus, [PAWN_pronoun] sold all [PAWN_possessive] possessions, purchased the largest rifle [PAWN_pronoun] could find, and began to hunt mechanoids.

Biosphere manager - [PAWN_nameDef] lived on a section of a peaceful glitterworld where people lived in harmony with nature. [PAWN_pronoun] was in charge of maintaining one of the extremely large nature preserves on the planet's surface.  Drones and mechanoids handled most of the menial labor, which left [PAWN_nameDef] with plenty of time to study plant and animal life in the field.

Hunter - No matter what handicap [PAWN_possessive] imposed on himself, hunting animals proved no challenge whatsoever.  [PAWN_nameDef] resorted to abducting other humans and hunting them for sport.

Mech preserve manager - [PAWN_nameDef] was in charge of patrolling the border of a wide containment zone that was the home of numerous feral mechanoids.  If a particularly threatening specimen was spotted, [PAWN_pronoun] would organize a hunting party to neutralize it. 

Veterinarian - [PAWN_nameDef] practiced the medical treatment of animals.  Most of [PAWN_possessive] patients were the typical cats and dogs, although occasionally [PAWN_pronoun] had the opportunity to work with more exotic species.

Preservation manager - Some poachers assumed that because a nearby glitterworld was peaceful, its nature preserves would make easy hunting of rare (and thus valuable) animals.  [PAWN_nameDef] was in charge of maintaining one such nature preserve's biodiversity.  [PAWN_pronoun] educated the public on how important biodiversity was and fragile some ecosystems could be.  Poachers were taught a supplemental lesson on how other ecosystems were not so easy to disrupt.

Cult child - [PAWN_nameDef] was born into a large cult, working long hours extracting raw resources from the earth to build monuments for the true faith.  However, a chance unsecured logistics terminal gave [PAWN_nameDef] a glimpse into the outside world. [PAWN_possessive] eyes opened, [PAWN_pronoun] escaped the first opportunity [PAWN_pronoun] got.

Vatborn cultist - [PAWN_nameDef] was artficially grown to be an initiate of a large cult.  This was a not uncommon practice on many worlds where cults needed to secretly expand their size.

Vatborn cultist - [PAWN_nameDef] was artficially grown to be an initiate of a large cult.  However, a love of literature and learning allowed doubt to enter [PAWN_possessive] mind and shake the indoctrination.  [PAWN_possessive] eyes opened, [PAWN_pronoun] escaped the first chance [PAWN_pronoun] got.

Cult enforcer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult, maintaining dicipline and "motivating" members to keep the faith.  [PAWN_possessive] higher-ups, for their part, found [PAWN_objective] the perfect follower, loyal and always willing to follow orders.

Cult enforcer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult, maintaining dicipline and "motivating" members to keep the faith.  This suited [PAWN_objective] well, as the screams of the faithful were as birdsong to their master.

Cult enforcer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult, protecting the faithful from prying eyes of the law and facilitating unfortunate accidents for prying academics and dogged journalists who refused to stop asking questions.

Cult enforcer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult.  After [PAWN_pronoun] failed to complete a mission, [PAWN_possessive] superiors made an example of [PAWN_objective] to inspire the other faithful.  [PAWN_possessive] mind never truly recovered.

Cult troubleshooter - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult, discretely removing threats and opponents of the true faith.

Cult troubleshooter - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult.  [PAWN_nameDef] was called upon when threats to the true faith had grown to a level where discretion was no longer a factor.

Cult scholar - [PAWN_nameDef] initially came into contact with a large cult to study their belief system.  It wasn't long before [PAWN_pronoun] was enlightened to the true faith.

Cult scholar - A scholar of ancient folklore, [PAWN_nameDef] discovered the texts buried deep in the university archives described a belief system remarkably similar to that which the new ideoligion [PAWN_pronoun] had seen was preaching.  [PAWN_nameDef] quickly focused [PAWN_possessive] studies on this similarity, but abandoned such frivolities upon being enlightened to the true faith.

Cult scholar - [PAWN_nameDef] discovered a number of ancient tomes in a hidden chamber of [PAWN_possessive] father's estate.  Through years of study, [PAWN_pronoun] learned [PAWN_possessive] house had turned its back on the old ways.  After a series of unfortunate accidents left [PAWN_nameDef] in control of [PAWN_possessive] house, the cult found a powerful ally already enlightened to the true faith.       

Cult ritualist - [PAWN_nameDef] was already enlightened to the true faith.  [PAWN_pronoun] studied ancient rituals, pouring over the subtle variations listed archaic tomes, looking to reduce the cost various rites had on human resources.

Cult initiate - [PAWN_nameDef] was a lower level initiate in a large cult, a position which was no small source of insecurity. To prove [PAWN_possessive] loyality and worth to the true faith, [PAWN_nameDef] volunteered for many dangerous missions [PAWN_pronoun] was less than qualified for.

Cult initiate - [PAWN_nameDef] was a lower level initiate in a large cult and totally loyal to the true faith.  After all, [PAWN_possessive] masters provided for all [PAWN_pronoun] would ask for.  Importantly, [PAWN_pronoun] knew what [PAWN_pronoun] was allowed to ask for.

Cult initiate - [PAWN_nameDef] was a lower level initiate in a large cult and less than totally loyal to the true faith.  When [PAWN_pronoun] had joined, the promises had been so sweet, but [PAWN_pronoun] quickly soured after seeing a disasterous ritual.  Still, [PAWN_pronoun] knew what happened to those who showed less than absolute devotion.

Cult initiate - [PAWN_nameDef] was a lower level initiate in a large cult and finally totally loyal to the true faith.  Yes, [PAWN_pronoun] had wavered in the past, but [PAWN_pronoun] had since been appropriately "diciplined."

Cult prosyltizer - [PAWN_nameDef] recruited many believers into the true faith.  Many were initially attracted by promises of power, euphoria, or pleasure, but once [PAWN_nameDef] had [PAWN_possessive] hooks in [PAWN_possessive] target, it wasn't long before they were truly enlightened.

Seeker of the king - A high ranking member of a cult, [PAWN_nameDef] sought to find [PAWN_possessive] king.  Worse, [PAWN_pronoun] knew where to find him:\n\nAlong the shores the cloud waves break,\nthe twin suns sink behind the lake, \nthe shadows lengthen\nin Carcosa.

Nemesis of reason - Words describing [PAWN_nameDef] fail. Tales recounting [PAWN_objective] end without warning.

Failed psycaster - After attending a university for psycasters, [PAWN_nameDef] discovered [PAWN_pronoun] was uniquely unqualified.  [PAWN_possessive] professors described [PAWN_objective] as the "psychic equivalent of the number zero."\n\nDespite having the spirit of a psycaster, [PAWN_possessive] survival was better attributed to having the body of a long distance sprinter. 

Rimworld tourist - [PAWN_nameDef] hailed from a world where gold was amazingly common where [PAWN_pronoun] worked as an "inn-sewer-ants" agent. [PAWN_pronoun] travelled to many worlds and recorded [PAWN_possessive] experiences in the famous novel "What I Did on my Holidays."

Colony patrician - [PAWN_nameDef] ruled a sizable colony on the Rim as dictator in all but name. [PAWN_possessive] colony thrived under [PAWN_objective], as [PAWN_possessive] ruled with more of a velvet glove than an iron fist, following [PAWN_possessive] family's motto of "si non confectus, non reficiat."\n\n[PAWN_possessive] other great joy, besides ensuring the colony ran like clockwork, was pampering [PAWN_possessive] dog.

Uncanny assassin - [PAWN_nameDef] was raised as an assassin from a young age and became near infamous in certain circles for a series of particularly brutal murders. [PAWN_possessive] mind has been likened to a shattered mirror - something brilliant, sharp, and dazzling, but also fundamentally and irrevocably broken.

Reformed conman - Wanted dead in multiple colonies for [PAWN_possessive] cons, [PAWN_nameDef] was finally caught and hung within a literal inch of [PAWN_possessive] life. Afterwards, [PAWN_pronoun] was given the chance to turn [PAWN_possessive] life around, applying [PAWN_possessive] skills at repairing some of the failing institutions of a large colony.

Watch commander - [PAWN_nameDef] served as the commander of a sprawling, chaotic colony's watch. [PAWN_pronoun] dragged the ramshackle force from a disreputable gang into a semblance of a real police unit, mostly through sheer grit and an uncanny understanding of the criminal mind. Cynical and world-weary, [PAWN_nameDef] was often described as two drinks short of sober. Nevertheless, [PAWN_pronoun] clung to a stubborn, street-level sense of justice.

Watch captain - [PAWN_nameDef] served as the captain of a sprawling, chaotic colony's watch.  Despite the rim's best efforts, [PAWN_pronoun] remained honest, good-natured, and honourable. Being able to punch the lights out of a Hussar bugged out on go-juice didn't hurt.

Adopted by dirtmoles - [PAWN_nameDef] was found and raised by a colony of dirtmoles.  [PAWN_possessive] above average height earned [PAWN_objective] the moniker Kzad-bhat, or "Head Banger."

Sausage salesman - On every world along the rim and core, there would be someone like [PAWN_nameDef], someone who would be selling sausages of suspicious origin and at such a low price that [PAWN_pronoun] would insist "that it's cutting me own throat."\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing thing was that despite the fact that [PAWN_nameDef]'s sausages tasted objectively worse than nutrient paste, people would find themselves buying another some time later.

Quartermaster - [PAWN_nameDef] served as quartermaster for a number of different losing militaries and was probably the only human who ever needed a signed document that read: "following affidavits from the midwife and a doctor, I confirm that the bearer is, in all probability, human."

Seamster - [PAWN_nameDef] was a member of the Seamstresses' Guild in a large city.  However, anyone calling upon the guild to have their clothing mended would be disappointed, as the members of the guild were better known for performing services that didn't require any garments. 

Deranged inventor - [PAWN_nameDef] was not an idiot; [PAWN_pronoun] was as far as from an idiot as it was possible to be, just from the complete opposite end of the spectrum as a genius.  After all, no idiot could have made explosive compounds out of common sand and water. No idiot could create architectural plans for a mansion that relied on triangles drawn with three right angles.

Hallboy - [PAWN_nameDef] spent much of their early life as a low ranked domestic worker in service of a great house, doing some of least pleasant and menial jobs. [PAWN_pronoun] learned to do these tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Theological scholar - [PAWN_nameDef] was a well respected scholar in [PAWN_possessive] ideoligion.  [PAWN_pronoun] served on a council to decide whether certain animals found on the Rim were acceptable to eat based on their ideoligion's existing dietary restrictions.

Theologian - [PAWN_nameDef] became well known for [PAWN_possessive] extensive commentaries on [PAWN_possessive] ideoligion's sacred texts.  However, few knew that [PAWN_possessive] scholarship was merely a hobby, and that [PAWN_pronoun] made a living as a vintner.

Task force operative - [PAWN_nameDef] served on a team that provided rapid response to anomalous threats. 

Nine-tailed fox - [PAWN_nameDef] was a member of an elite mobile task force that was dispatched to deal with containment breaches of anomalous entities.

[PAWN_nameDef] trained in ancient rites and battle tactics in preparation for the day [PAWN_pronoun] would called upon to fulfill their destiny. 

Trial overseer - [PAWN_nameDef] oversaw the coming-of-age trials of [PAWN_possessive] tribe, guiding them through the wasteland. [PAWN_nameDef] knew it would only be a matter of time before the blood machines returned to raze their homes, so [PAWN_pronoun] taught [PAWN_possessive] charges how to survive in the harshest of environments.

Promethean thief - [PAWN_nameDef] led many expeditions into the wastelands to steal the magic metal of the blood machines. Some of the things [PAWN_pronoun] brought back were magic torchs that would not go out and sticks that shot lightning.

Steelslayer - A brave warrior skilled with the spear, [PAWN_nameDef] attained great honor defeating a Bladed End in single combat: a monster made of shining teeth and claws, sent by the gods to test [PAWN_possessive] tribe.

Banished warrior - Despite being [PAWN_possessive] original tribe's most skilled warrior, [PAWN_nameDef] was banished for the grave offense of having two lovers, rather than the one permitted by tradition and law.

Mushroom farmer - Hailing from the frozen north, [PAWN_nameDef] helped sustain [PAWN_possessive] tribe by digging large underground caves where they cultivated large quantities of fungus.

Tribal hacker - Through extensive trial and error, [PAWN_nameDef] discovered many sealed iron doors could be opened by interacting with the glowscreen and gently pressing the upwards pointing glyph enough times, followed by a vigorous smash to the big red button.
