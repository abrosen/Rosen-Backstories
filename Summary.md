Enigma - Systems have almost no records of [PAWN_nameDef]'s childhood, nor any explanation of how [PAWN_pronoun] rose to such a high rank at such an early age.  The only thing sparse accounts can agree on is the [PAWN_nameDef] has always been preternaturally beautiful and always able to convince others to do exactly what [PAWN_pronoun] needed.

Shipborn engineer - Despite all the cautions, regulations, and prophylactics intended to prevent shipborn pregnancies, it is not uncommon for a child to be born on a ship during a long transit.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] spent [PAWN_possessive] childhood aboard one such ship, obesssively learning the ins and outs of the engine room and all the maintenance required to keep [PAWN_possessive] home among the stars going.        

Expedition survivor - After an ill-fated expedition drew the ire of a particularly malevolent archotech, [PAWN_nameDef] has been on the run ever since.  [PAWN_nameDef] jumped from colony to colony, pursued by mechanoids and horrid fleshbeasts. Despite the overwhelming odds, [PAWN_nameDef] has survived everything coming [PAWN_possessive] way and has become quite proficient at dispatching threats.

Glitterworld physician - Even in a world mostly free of disease and human suffering, there were still accidents that required quick human intervention.  While not as lucrative a career as cosmetic alterations and much more stressful, [PAWN_nameDef] found [PAWN_possessive] time as a emergency physician much more worthwhile.  Eventually, [PAWN_nameDef] adapted to the long hours without resorting to wake-up or copious amounts of caffeine.

Dealmaker - Almost nothing is known about [PAWN_nameDef] save that [PAWN_pronoun] has some role in recruiting members of an ill-fated expedition to study an apparently dormant archotech.  All other records describing [PAWN_objective] have all been expunged. Two things, however, are certain: [PAWN_nameDef] never made a promise [PAWN_pronoun] couldn't keep and [PAWN_pronoun] never forgot a debt [PAWN_pronoun] owed.   

Archotech salvager - [PAWN_nameDef] made a living hunting for ruined or dormant archotech relics and ship parts, extracting their vanometric power cells and other such technologies.  This took [PAWN_objective] both to the deep depths of planets and the far reaches of [PAWN_possessive] solar system.

Zoo interpreter - [PAWN_nameDef] worked at a famous zoo as an educator, explaining the behavior of animals to guests. [PAWN_possessive] passion about wildlife was extremely contagious to everyone [PAWN_pronoun] met.

Medieval enthusiast - Teaching at a glitterworld university, [PAWN_nameDef]'s research focused on the history of combat techniques from thousands of years ago.  This may just have been an excuse for [PAWN_objective] to get paid for [PAWN_possessive] hobby of dressing up in armor and pretending to be a knight.\n\nWhile [PAWN_nameDef] spent a considerable amount of time outdoors thanks to [PAWN_possessive] hobby, very little of it was spent in green spaces or wilderness.

Waste of talent - [PAWN_nameDef] was naturally good at everything, but completely unmotivated to make anything of [PAWN_possessive] life.

Food chemist - [PAWN_nameDef] lived a life of luxury on a glitterworld. [PAWN_possessive] primary research involved creating new and exotic artificial flavors.

Glitterworld librarian - [PAWN_nameDef] managed an enormous library on a glitterworld. [PAWN_possessive] ability to sift through billions of of entries and materials in a matter of seconds was matched only by their complete incompetence in crafts.  There was nothing physical [PAWN_nameDef] could make that would not collapse in a matter of seconds.

Inventive janitor - Held captive on a space satellite and forced by mad scientists to watch cheesy movies (the worst they could find) [PAWN_nameDef] was only able to keep [PAWN_possessive] sanity with the help of [PAWN_possessive] robot friends. [PAWN_nameDef] crafted the aforementioned robots [PAWN_possessive]self, using spare parts from the satellite \n\nDespite the dire, dangerous, and utterly bizarre conditions [PAWN_pronoun] found [PAWN_possessive]self in, [PAWN_nameDef] maintained a positive attitude throughout it all.

Knight - [PAWN_nameDef] served in the army as a means to live the dream of being a knight. Wealthy, [PAWN_pronoun] could afford the most advanced powered armor to protect [PAWN_possessive] skin.

Retired programmer - [PAWN_nameDef] worked as a programmer for a number years at a large corporation before abruptly quitting to cultivate [PAWN_possessive] own farm, a surprisingly common occurrence on many an urbworld and midworld.

Charitable physician - [PAWN_nameDef] would travel to settlements without medical infrastucture to provide care for those who would otherwise be unable to receive it.  Despite the constant danger, [PAWN_pronoun] abided by a millennia old oath to do no harm.\n\n[PAWN_possessive] patients would remember [PAWN_possessive] calm and kind demeanor years after.

Medieval knight - [PAWN_nameDef] was drafted into [PAWN_possessive] lord's army. [PAWN_pronoun] was knighted for saving the life of the crown prince on the battlefield, at great personal risk.

Theological scholar - [PAWN_nameDef] was a well respected scholar in [PAWN_possessive] ideoligion.  [PAWN_pronoun] served in a council to decide whether certain animals found on the Rim were acceptable to eat based on their ideoligion's existing dietary restrictions.

Klutzy researcher - Despite being quite adept at the scientific theory in [PAWN_possessive] field, [PAWN_nameDef]'s advancement was stymied by [PAWN_possessive] constant clumsiness ruining any experiment [PAWN_pronoun] came up with.

Xenogeneticist - While [PAWN_pronoun] could have easily made a living as a model, [PAWN_nameDef] found [PAWN_objective]self drawn towards more intellectual pursuits. The majority of [PAWN_nameDef]'s efforts were spent on the research and development of new xenogerms treatments of genetic disorders.\n\n[PAWN_possessive] career was interrupted by the sudden decline of their glitterworld;  [PAWN_nameDef]'s ideoligion made a convenient scapegoat and [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to flee the planet.

Infantry engineer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as an engineer in the army on a relatively peaceful urbworld. Most of [PAWN_possessive] active service was spent in disaster recovery efforts. Fortunately many of the same skills needed to sap walls or build bridges and defenses were easily transferable to rescue operations and building shelters.  This was probably for the best, as [PAWN_pronoun] was barely able to take a punch from a genie.

Mobile infantryman - [PAWN_nameDef]'s planet made some form of military or government service a requirement of gaining the right to vote. [PAWN_pronoun] joined the mobile infantry and took to maneuvering in powered armor like a fish to water.  The majority of his deployment was spent fighting against an incursion of the Sorne geneline on his and nearby planets.  Despite the horrors of war, [PAWN_nameDef] maintained an unshakable confidence that [PAWN_pronoun] would pull through no matter what.

Mobile infantryman - [PAWN_nameDef] joined the mobile infantry to fight the Sorne geneline's incursion on a nearby world.  [PAWN_possessive] first drop against the bugs ended in disaster, with [PAWN_nameDef] being the only survivor.  However, due to a computer glitch, [PAWN_pronoun] was sent on drops again and again without time for rest.

Biosphere manager - [PAWN_nameDef] lived on a section of a peaceful glitterworld where people lived in harmony with nature. [PAWN_pronoun] was in charge of maintaining one of the extremely large nature preserves on the planet's surface.  Drones and mechanoids handled most of the menial labor, which left [PAWN_nameDef] with plenty of time to study plant and animal life in the field.

Spy - [PAWN_nameDef] was an extremely accomplished spy, specializing in impersonation and long-term infiltration.  [PAWN_possessive] career was interrupted by the sudden decline of their glitterworld.  [PAWN_nameDef]'s ideoligion made a convenient scapegoat and [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to flee the planet when their loyalty was called into question.

Glitterworld politician - [PAWN_nameDef] served as a democratically elected leader in a prosperous glitterworld.  While [PAWN_possessive] tenure was originally seen as a time of prosperity, [PAWN_possessive] immediate successor implemented radical policies that led to the rapid decline of [PAWN_possessive] home planet. [PAWN_nameDef]'s ideoligion made a convenient scapegoat and [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to flee the planet.

Duelist - While outlawed on some worlds, dueling remained a popular way to settle disputes on many others, especially among the nobility and upper classes.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] gained renown on one such world for [PAWN_possessive] skill with the blade.  [PAWN_pronoun] spent much of their spare time honing their skills and studying ancient treatises.

Gunner - [PAWN_nameDef] firmly believed that any problem could be solved with the judicious application of more firepwower.  Unfortunately, [PAWN_possessive] passion for destruction left very little room any interest in construction.

Theologian - [PAWN_nameDef] became well known for [PAWN_possessive] extensive commentaries on [PAWN_possessive] ideoligion's sacred texts.  However, few knew that [PAWN_possessive] scholarship was merely a hobby, and that [PAWN_pronoun] made a living as a vintner.

Ordinary colonist - [PAWN_nameDef] records are startlingly unremarkable and contain no data of interest or importance.  It is not suspicious in the slightest.

Blood knight - [PAWN_nameDef] wanted nothing more in life than a small farm to call [PAWN_possessive] own and a partner to settle down with.  Or so [PAWN_nameDef] believed until [PAWN_possessive] small village was attacked by a group of sanguophages.  After beheading three of them with nothing more than a farming implement, something awoke within [PAWN_objective].\n\nSince that day, [PAWN_nameDef] has been seeking out any excuse to get into danger, to feel that thrill of being on the knife's edge between life and death.

Ship stealer - Despite being absolutely sickened by the idea of hurting another human, [PAWN_nameDef] became one of the most notorius and successful pirates of [PAWN_possessive] generation.  Once, alone, [PAWN_pronoun] even stole a large destroyer that required a thrity person crew.

Quarantine child - Before [PAWN_nameDef] could even speak, [PAWN_possessive] world was ravaged by worldwide pandemic. The next few years of [PAWN_possessive] life were spent in isolation with only [PAWN_possessive] parents for company. However, [PAWN_possessive] parents kept [PAWN_objective] busy, nurturing a natural talent for the arts and sciences.

Troublesome child - Born into an extremely large family, [PAWN_nameDef] was starved for attention.  [PAWN_pronoun] solved this problem by creating a number of contraptions that made noises, created messes, and were otherwise generally quite meddlesome.

Missionary - [PAWN_nameDef] spent over a year serving on a charitable mission on behalf of [PAWN_possessive] ideoligion. The combination of charity work and proselytizing left [PAWN_nameDef] with a smattering of useful skills.

Daydreaming student - [PAWN_nameDef]'s spent much of [PAWN_possessive] time in school daydreaming about exploring strange new worlds, preferably on a five-year mission.  While [PAWN_possessive] performance in school was less than stellar, [PAWN_nameDef] always maintained a positive outlook on their future.

Daydreaming student - [PAWN_nameDef] was convinced they were special and had hidden, yet to be unleashed, secret powers.

Although psycaster powers never manifested themselves, [PAWN_possessive] fantasies were an outlet for [PAWN_possessive] considerable imagination.

Chosen one - [PAWN_nameDef]'s birth was heralded as the arrival of the Chosen One, [PAWN_pronoun] who was destined to drive the steel beasts back to the black skies. [PAWN_nameDef] trained in ancient rites and battle tactics in preparation for the day [PAWN_pronoun] would called upon to fulfill their destiny.

Medical student - [PAWN_nameDef] studied at a prestigious medical academy.  Despite glitterworld technology being able to heal the most grevious of wounds with the push of a button, [PAWN_possessive] university emphasized the need for the traditional, hands-on skills so many physicians had relied on over the millennia.

Raw recruit - [PAWN_nameDef] was born to an impovershed class on a crowded but technically advanced urbworld.  Many members of [PAWN_possessive] family choose military service as their best chance to improve their grim lot in life. [PAWN_nameDef] was no exception and joined as soon as [PAWN_pronoun] was of age.  Once there, [PAWN_pronoun] found [PAWN_pronoun] was an excellent shot.

Nature lover - [PAWN_nameDef] had a love for learning about all natural things and had her family take [PAWN_objective] to every nature preserve on [PAWN_possessive] glitterworld.

Prepper kid - [PAWN_nameDef] was raised by parents who were convinced that the apocalypse was coming any day now and were determined to survive it.  [PAWN_possessive] upbringing made [PAWN_objective] quite prepared for life on the Rim, but left [PAWN_possessive] social skills quite atrophied.

Cult enforcer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult, maintaining dicipline and "motivating" members to keep the faith.  [PAWN_possessive] higher-ups, for their part, found [PAWN_objective] the perfect follower, loyal and always willing to follow orders.

Cult enforcer - [PAWN_nameDef] served as part of the enforcement arm of a large cult, maintaining dicipline and "motivating" members to keep the faith.  This suited [PAWN_objective] well, as the screams of the faithful were as birdsong to their master.

Cult scholar - A scholar of ancient folklore, [PAWN_nameDef] discovered the texts buried deep in the university archives described a belief system remarkably similar to that which the new ideoligion [PAWN_pronoun] had seen was preaching.

Cult scholar - [PAWN_nameDef] discovered a number of ancient tomes in a hidden chamber of [PAWN_possessive] father's estate.  Through years of study, [PAWN_pronoun] learned [PAWN_possessive] house had turned its back on the old ways.  After a series of unfortunate accidents left [PAWN_nameDef] in control of [PAWN_possessive] house, the cult found a powerful ally already enlightened to the true faith.

Cult initiate - [PAWN_nameDef] was a lower level initiate in a large cult, a position which was no small source of insecurity. To prove [PAWN_possessive] loyality and worth to the true faith, [PAWN_nameDef] volunteered for many dangerous missions [PAWN_pronoun] was less than qualified for.

Cult initiate - [PAWN_nameDef] was a lower level initiate in a large cult and totally loyal to the true faith.  After all, [PAWN_possessive] masters provided for all [PAWN_pronoun] would ask for.  Importantly, [PAWN_pronoun] knew what [PAWN_pronoun] was allowed to ask for.

Seeker of the king - A high ranking member of a cult, [PAWN_nameDef] sought to find [PAWN_possessive] king.  Worse, [PAWN_pronoun] knew where to find him:\n\nAlong the shores the cloud waves break,\nthe twin suns sink behind the lake, \nthe shadows lengthen\nin Carcosa.

Nemesis of reason - Words describing [PAWN_nameDef] fail. Tales recounting [PAWN_objective] end without warning.

Failed psycaster - After attending a university for psycasters, [PAWN_nameDef] discovered [PAWN_pronoun] was uniquely unqualified.  [PAWN_possessive] professors described [PAWN_objective] as the "psychic equivalent of the number zero."\n\nDespite having the spirit of a psycaster, [PAWN_possessive] survival was better attributed to having the body of a long distance sprinter.

Rimworld tourist - [PAWN_nameDef] hailed from a world where gold was amazingly common. [PAWN_pronoun] travelled to many worlds and recorded [PAWN_possessive] experiences in the famous novel "What I Did on my Holidays."

Colony patrician - [PAWN_nameDef] ruled a sizable colony on the Rim as dictator in all but name. [PAWN_possessive] colony thrived under [PAWN_possessive], as [PAWN_possessive] ruled with more of a velvet glove, rather than an iron fist, following [PAWN_possessive] family's motto of "si non confectus, non reficiat."\n\n[PAWN_possessive] other great joy, besides ensuring the colony ran like clockwork, was pampering [PAWN_possessive] dog.

Uncanny assassin - [PAWN_nameDef] was raised as an assassin from a young age and became near infamous in certain circles for a series of particularly brutal murders. [PAWN_possessive] mind has been likened to a shattered mirror - something brilliant, sharp, and dazzling, but also fundamentally and irrevocably broken.

Reformed conman - Wanted dead in multiple colonies for [PAWN_possessive] cons, [PAWN_nameDef] was finally caught and hung within a literal inch of [PAWN_possessive] life.

Watch commander - [PAWN_nameDef] served as the commander of a sprawling, chaotic colony's watch. [PAWN_pronoun] dragged the ramshackle force from a disreputable gang into a semblance of a real police unit, mostly through sheer grit and an uncanny understanding of the criminal mind. Cynical and world-weary, [PAWN_nameDef] was often described as two drinks short of sober. Nevertheless, [PAWN_pronoun] clung to a stubborn, street-level sense of justice.

Watch captain - [PAWN_nameDef] served as the captain of a sprawling, chaotic colony's watch.  Despite the rim's best efforts, [PAWN_pronoun] remained honest, good-natured, and honourable. Being able to punch the lights out of a Hussar bugged out on go-juice didn't hurt.

Adopted by dirtmoles - [PAWN_nameDef] was found and raised by a colony of dirtmoles.  [PAWN_possessive] above average height earned [PAWN_objective] the moniker Kzad-bhat, or "Head Banger."

Sausage salesman - On every world along the rim and core, there would be someone like [PAWN_nameDef], someone who would be selling sausages of suspicious origin and at such a low price that [PAWN_pronoun] would insist "that it's cutting me own throat."\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing thing was that despite the fact that [PAWN_nameDef]'s sausages tasted objectively worse than nutrient paste, people would find themselves buying another some time later.

Quartermaster - [PAWN_nameDef] served as quartermaster for a number of different losing militaries and was probably the only human who ever needed a signed document that read: "following affidavits from the midwife and a doctor, I confirm that the bearer is, in all probability, human."

Trial overseer - [PAWN_nameDef] oversaw the coming-of-age trials of [PAWN_possessive] tribe, guiding them through the wasteland. [PAWN_nameDef] knew it would only be a matter of time before the blood machines returned to raze their homes, so [PAWN_pronoun] taught [PAWN_possessive] charges how to survive in the harshest of environments.

Promethean thief - [PAWN_nameDef] led many expeditions into the wastelands to steal the magic metal of the blood machines. Some of the things [PAWN_pronoun] brought back were magic torchs that would not go out and sticks that shot lightning.

Steelslayer - A skilled warrior with the spear, [PAWN_nameDef] attained great honor the day [PAWN_pronoun] single-handedly slew a twinbladed blood machine.
