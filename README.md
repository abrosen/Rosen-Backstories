# Rosen-Backstories
![Preview Image](About/Preview.png "Preview")

Part serious mod, part attempt to learn to mod RimWorld.  My initial goal was to add   more variety to the "Researcher" category of backstories, since "The Anomaly" backstories felt unvaried.  As such things happen, this mod has expanded in scope to add some book and media references, add additional generic childhood backstories, and add some knights, and some classic old scifi.
    
The mod does not require additional mods, but some backstories will take advantage of Vanilla Traits Expanded and Vanilla Armour Expanded if you have them. Most of the backstories have a thematically appropriate forced trait, which makes debugging a bit easier for me.  For example, the "Waste of Talent" backstory forces the Slowpoke and Slothful traits.

GNU Terry Pratchett.

## Philosophy

### Lore
- Backstories should be lore friendly. 
  - Backstories from other media franchises are fine, but should be adapted to be as lore friendly as possible, such at discworld dwarves becoming dirtmoles.
- Most backstories are meant for players and their pawns.
  - Almost all backstories will have the "offworld" to generate pawns for crashlanded.
  - Science and spooky backstories come with the "researcher" tag for Anomaly DLC.
  - Military backstories will have "ImperialFighter" when it would make sense to find this backstory in the Empire faction. 
  - Most backstories with "cult" don't work as anything but as Servants of Horax or some other large cult.
    - Cult backstories are written assuming that they are Horax's cultists, but are generic enough for another mod to use the.
    - Cult backstories have intentionally identical descriptions and cadence.  
      - They aren't a hivemind, they are the true faith, united in the glory of the true master(s).
      - Hopefully, this will add a nice creepy ambiance to any player who starts looking at the pawn bios during a raid.


### Mechanics
- I tend to avoid too many restrictive backstories as that is not what most players are looking for.
- Many adult backstories are balanced around a +6/+4/+2 bonus with a positive trait.
- Backstories are allowed to be stronger, but definitely need some drawback or must be extremely compelling.
